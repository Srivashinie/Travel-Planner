# PlanMyTrip

Our Travel Planner Application will help users plan their trips by generating personalized itineraries and suggesting hotels, restaurants, and attractions based on their chosen destination.

Weâ€™ve decided to use Python because it has many libraries for working with APIs, handling data, and building web applications using frameworks like Flask.
