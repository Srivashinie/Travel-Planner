**4. Workflow**
- We will use python, html and css to develop this application.
- The user inputs their travel details such as dates, preferences and submits them.
- The frontend then displays the itinerary and recommendations with options for the user to customize.
- The backend processes this input by fetching data from APIs and the database, generates recommendations and creates the itinerary and then sends the results back to the frontend.
- The database stores and retrieves user preferences, itineraries, activity details, and updates dynamic information like weather
- The folder structure for the project: 
  /app.py file to initialize the application 
  /views/routes to handles different routes for the pages
  /templates folder has different templates for pages like itinerary.html, recommendations.html, form.html
  /db folder to manage the database connection
  /static/styles.css has all the styling for the application
  /requirements.txt to indicate all the dependencies and packages to install
